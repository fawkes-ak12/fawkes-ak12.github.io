                        <li>Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist and politician who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. 
                            He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering.</li>
                        <li> He spent the next four 
                            decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and 
                            Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military 
                            missile development efforts.</li>
                        <li>He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of 
                            ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political 
                            role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</li>
                        <li>Kalam was elected
                            as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition 
                            Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education, 
                            writing and public service after a single term.</li>
                        <li>He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna,
                            India's highest civilian honour. </li>
                        <li> While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed 
                            and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, 
                            attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.  </li>
                        <li> Kalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. </li>
                        <li> He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, 
                            surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 
                            25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007.</li>
